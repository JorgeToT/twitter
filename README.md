This project contains 3 classes: User, User Service and User View.
Each one contain a specific test to check the functionality of the project.

User contains a constructor and a method to get and set the information of the user.

User Service contains a static method to create a new user and a method to get all the usernames from a list of names, contains a method to get the users information and a method to update the username.

User view contains a static method to create a user using as parameter a payload, and make a serie of verifications to check if the user data is valid.

I used TDD to construct the project, and I used the following tools for the tests: Jest.

To start use the command:
`npm start`

To run test use the command:
`npm test`
